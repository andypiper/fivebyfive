# How to Contribute

The goal of this project is to aggregate information, and different examples, to enable the community to learn and use the ESP32-C3FH4-RGB board created by 01Space.  Patches (pull requests) and bug reports are welcome! I'm learning here, so I could easily have missed something, or you might know a way to do something better than I do...
